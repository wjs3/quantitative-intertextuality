CHAPTER LXXXVI.



ENTITLED, THE STAR WHICH APPEARED BY NIGHT; REVEALED AT MECCA.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     BY the heaven, and that which appeareth by night:

     but what shall cause thee to understand what that which appeareth by

night is?

     it is the star of piercing brightness:

     every soul hath a guardian set over it.

     Let a man consider, therefore, of what he is created.

     He is created of seed poured forth,

     issuing from the loins, and the breastbones.

     Verily God is able to restore him to life,

     the day whereon all secret thoughts and actions shall be examined into;

10     and he shall have no power to defend himself, nor any protector.

     By the heaven which returneth the rain;

     and by the earth which openeth to let forth vegetables and springs:

     verily this is a discourse distinguishing good from evil:

     and it is not composed with lightness.

     Verily the infidels are laying a plot to frustrate my designs:

     but I will lay a plot for their ruin.

     Wherefore, O prophet, bear with the unbelievers: let them alone a while.
